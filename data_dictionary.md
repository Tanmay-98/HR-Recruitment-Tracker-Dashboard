## ðŸ”¥ **4. Potential Issues and Data Quality Considerations**

- **Missing Values:** Ensure that all date columns are filled to prevent calculation errors.
- **Data Inconsistencies:** Verify the format of dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Data Validation:** Ensure that job titles are consistent and standardized (e.g., 'HR Manager' vs. 'Human Resources Manager').
- **Drop-off Stage Calculation:** Verify that the drop-off stage is correctly marked for candidates who did not proceed to the next round.
